Learning GitHub!

Used TFS for long time, and this exercise is to learn GitHub properly and 
implement source control system using the best practices followed in the industry!

This is the 4th solution in the last 8 years, started off with SVN, then moved to VSS
As both VSS, SVN could not solve our purpose, decided to move to TFS considering 
TFS will have requirement to production release including project management as a single tool.

One session completed today 18 Dec 2018, and this exercise is for understanding 
repositories, pull request and review
